				<h3>About Us</h3>

					Founded by Bert Pearson, we have been the Carolina's 
					core surf shop since 1965. After falling in love with 
					the sport of surfing in the early 60s, Bert realized 
					the state of North Carolina was in need of a surf 
					shop and in the small coastal town of Emerald Isle, he 
					opened up our first of many locations.  Bert at 91 years 
					old still frequents each of his locations every week!

					At Bert's we specilze in all surf and skate products. 
					We carry everything from beginner level surfboards to 
					the finest locally shaped and high end boards! You can 
					also fine a full selection of every size and shape of 
					skateboard. As well as our full line up of hard goods, 
					we over a full array of surf and skate apparel. From 
					t-shirts, flops, and bathing suits, we can get you 
					outfitted in the sickest brand name threads!
